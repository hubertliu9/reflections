How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    If the code worked previously, you can easily see what has been changed because that's probably where the bug is. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It's a good habit and if the code gets long you don't spend hours to debug the code. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

 You get to choose the point that you'd like to save a version, so you don't have too many. But autosave helps when you have a power failure.   

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 Because programs are usually made of multiple files.
